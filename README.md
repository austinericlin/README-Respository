# README - REPOSITORY
This is a readme where I'm going through and formatting this document according to Markdown's syntax.

Most Markdown applications support some basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design documents. A guide to some of the basic syntax used in Markdown is linked below:

# Add number signs in front of a word or phrase to create headings.
  Generally, the number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. One # sign is the equivalent of HTML heading level 1, for instance.
## This heading is an example of heading level 2.
  Two # signs were added before the text that went into the heading. And so it goes. 
  
# Emphasis can be hadded through bold and italicized text.
  To bold text, add two **astericks** or __underscores__ before and after words or phrases. If you just want to bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters l**ike thi**s.

  Italicized text only requires one *asterisk* or _underscore_ before and after words or phrases. To italicize just the middle of a word, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters l*ike s*o.
  
# Items can be ordered into ordered and unordered lists. 
1. To create an ordered list, just add line items like so.
2. Line items should be added with numbers, followed by periods.
3. These numbers don't actually have to be in numerical order, but these lists should start with the number one. 
4. Like so.

- To create an unordered list, add dashes, asterisks, or plus signs in front of line items.
- Like so.
  - Line items can be indented in order to create nested lists. Which can be exceedingly useful. 
- Be advised that some markdown applications might not support different list delimiters in the same list, so don't mix and match dashes, asterisks and plus signs. 
  - Just pick one and stick with it!

1. Numbered lists can also be nested with bulleted lists.
  - Like so.
  - Just remember to indent the nested items you want.
2. Again, this can prove to be exceedingly useful in terms of just ordering things. 
3. You can also add elements in lists while preserving the continuity of the list. 
4. Just indent the element four spaces or one tab. 

  Like so. This is a paragraph that should pop up in the middle of this list.

5. And here, the list should continue at the fifth item. 

# URLs and web pages can be linked using Markdown
To create a link, just enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses.

Like so: [LINK](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

That link should redirect you to a page that details some basic syntax in Markdown.
